# Support

If you love DDX, and want to give back to the community, there are many ways to do so.

## Testing

Testing is a great way to help us speed up development. Testing is required for all of our pull requests in order to assure the quality of our software, but lack of access to V5 hardware and time constraints can often make it difficult to get things tested quickly.

To get started, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/pCHr7XZUTj), and check out the pull requests that need testing in our GitHub repository.

## Contributing

Contributing is another great way to help us improve DDX. All contributions are welcome, no matter how large or small. We ask that before you contribute, you read the [contributing guide](./contribute.md).
