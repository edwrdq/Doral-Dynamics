# Doral Dynamics (DDX)

> **Precision in motion. Built for VRC.**

Doral Dynamics (DDX) is a next-generation motion and localization library for the VEX V5 platform.  
Forked from [LemLib](https://github.com/LemLib/LemLib), DDX extends the foundation with cutting-edge features designed for competition teams:

- ‚úÖ Modular architecture (odom, control, extras)  
- ‚úÖ Optional **Monte Carlo Localization (MCL)** module  
- ‚úÖ Configurable constants (no more hardcoding)  
- ‚úÖ **SD-card replay & logging** for auton debugging  
- ‚úÖ Field-aware geometry models (walls & prisms for distance sensor correction)  

DDX is developed by **Team 33172X (BLACKOUT)** and the Doral Robotics program, actively used in competition and tuned for real-world performance.
